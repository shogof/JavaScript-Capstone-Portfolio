# JavaScript-Capstone-Portfolio
 JavaScript-Capstone-Portfolio is my final project for a JavaScript course, featuring an interactive personal web portfolio built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It showcases my projects, skills, and achievements with a professional design. Explore the repository to see my front-end development approach and feel free to provide feedback.
